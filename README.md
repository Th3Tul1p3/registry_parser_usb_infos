# Reg_explorer
use registries HKLM\System and HKLM\Software. they must be at root of the project.
I want to correlate the informations regarding USB based on the FOR500 course from SANS. 
The main purpose is to learn Rust and how to get valuable informations from the registries on the USB that were plugged.
